# Micro Projects
Micro Projects are small‐scale efforts with minimal resources and short timelines. For a micro project:

## Purpose:
Establish a single, clear “why” that justifies a quick, focused effort (e.g., test a new process or solve a narrowly defined problem).

## Objectives:
Create one or two measurable, time‐bound targets (e.g., draft and distribute a one‐page user survey within two weeks).

## Scope:
Limit work to essential tasks only—exclude any activities that don’t directly support the objective (e.g., design survey questions, collect 20 responses, analyze results).

Together, a sharply defined purpose drives a concise objective, and a tightly bounded scope keeps the micro project achievable within a few days to weeks.
