# Quick Start

Follow these simple steps to set up your new project. Create a folder manually and then:

---

## 1. Set Up Your Project Folder

- Create a new folder named **my-project** (or whatever you like).
- Inside **my-project**, make these subfolders:
  - **Assets/**  
  - **Data/**  
  - **Docs/**  
  - **Functions/**  

Your folder should look like:

my-project/
│
├── Assets/
├── Data/
├── Docs/
└── Functions/


## 2. Define Your Project Phases

- Create a file named **phases.md** under **Docs/**.
- Outline your project’s major phases or milestones in **Docs/phases.md**.
- Example structure for **phases.md**:
  ```markdown
  # Project Phases

  1. Planning
  2. Prototyping
  3. Development
  4. Testing
  5. Deployment
  6. Maintenance


## 3. Create README.md
- Use ProjectTemplate.md (located in your template library) as a starting point.

- Copy its contents into README.md at the root of my-project/.

- Fill in the placeholders (project name, description, etc.) and remove any template comments.

---

## 4. Further Reading & References
- Docs/FolderStructure.md (for ASCII‐art directory diagrams)

- Docs/phases.md (your project phases)

- ProjectTemplate.md (for detailed instructions, if needed)

## 5. Coming Soon
- Add extensions or plugins to automate setup steps.

- Create browser extensions or IDE plugins to scaffold new projects more quickly.
