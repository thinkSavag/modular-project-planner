# Contributing to Modular Project Planner

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This project operates at the intersection of:
- **Digital access workflows**, made possible through open-source tools like GitHub
- **Legal access awareness**, especially in systems that restrict procedural transparency and equitable advocacy

We believe that building tools for one strengthens access to the other.

## 🛠️ Who Can Contribute (Right Now)

Public code contributions are **currently closed** while the modular framework is finalized.  
However, we encourage:
- Feedback and use-case sharing via GitHub Issues
- Suggestions to improve clarity, usability, or logic of module flows
- Private outreach for collaborators with aligned missions

---

## 📋 Once Contributions Open

When enabled, contributors will be asked to:
- Submit all changes via **pull request** to `main`
- Follow security and structural [ruleset guidelines](.github/rulesets/ProtectMainBranch.json)
- Respect the modular format (one issue = one logic scope)

All pull requests will be reviewed under branch protection.

## 💡 Thematic Guideline

This isn't just a GitHub project.
It’s a systems-access project.

If you're contributing:
- Consider not only _how_ your code runs,
- But _who_ it helps gain clarity, empowerment, or relief through structured process.
