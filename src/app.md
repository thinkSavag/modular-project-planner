## 🧠 Choose Your Path

### 🛋️ I Can’t Even Use the TV Remote
You're new to GitHub, open-source, or modular logic — and that’s okay.

- Start with `StartHereGuide.md` (low-pressure overview)
- Peek at `StartHereExample.md` for a filled-out sample
- Absolutely no expectations — this is here to build *access*, not judgment
- Leave a comment on how easy or hard that was. Ideas that can improve this process: [💌 Leave a Comment! - Next Step: Activate a Real Onboarding Flow #1](https://github.com/thinkSavag/modular-project-planner/issues/1)


- Non-Functional: Try building your own micro project using `micro-projects.md`

---

### 💻 Developer (beginner to intermediate)
You’ve written some code, maybe worked with Git, and want to get hands-on.

- Clone this repo  
- Open `/docs/StartHereGuide.md` to see where you can contribute

[see where you fit in to the build]

---

### 📊 Project Manager / Facilitator - Inactive Currently: Template Concept Below
You're here for structure, clarity, or to help guide others.

- Review the `README.md` to understand the mission
- Use `/docs/phases.md` to draft a clear path for your team
- Propose logic, UI, or doc edits via pull request (zero coding needed!)

---

### 🔥 Missa Level [Defying Containers & Traditional Rule Scope]
You’re building logic systems while debugging your own cognitive architecture.

- Operate in `/src/app.py` or `/src/modules/`
- Flag contradiction patterns, soft logic, or biased prompts
- Submit PRs with structure, sass, or safety updates
- Know when to burn it all down (and rebuild with elegance)

- Jk 😆, do none of that ☝️... Instead: 👉 PM @thinkSAVAG instead [let's build!]
