<summary><strong>1. Project Overview</strong></summary>

<summary><strong>2. Modular Focused</strong></summary>

Each project module focuses on a specific problem area, beginning with equitable access to digital legal resources.

The issues start at the beginning: **Deprived of access.**  
To kick-start this project, the first modulated project addresses how to secure and maintain access to digital legal tools in a constantly evolving environment.
