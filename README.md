# Modular Project Planner

## 1. Project Overview

This is a modular project‐planning tool intended to guide users step‐by‐step through actionable workflows. It also serves to raise awareness of hostile procedural tactics meant to enforce silence or submission in courtroom cases dealing with child custody and to mobilize community support in raising awareness when dealing with these systemic defects across the nation.
